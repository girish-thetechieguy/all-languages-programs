/**
 * Notes:
 * Key Features of JDK 1.0
 *
 * Platform Independence:
 * Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
 *
 * Object-Oriented:
 * Java is based on the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), supporting concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
 *
 * Simple Syntax:
 * Java's syntax is similar to C++, making it easier for developers familiar with those languages to adopt it.
 *
 * Automatic Memory Management:
 * Java includes garbage collection, which automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation.
 *
 * Multithreading:
 * Java provides built-in support for multithreaded programming, allowing concurrent execution of code.
 *
 * Rich Standard Library:
 * JDK 1.0 introduced a set of standard libraries for tasks such as networking, data structures, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
 *
 * Applets and AWT:
 * Java applets could be embedded in web pages, and the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) provided basic GUI components.
