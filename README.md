#### **Key Features of JDK 1.0**

    **Platform Independence:**
        Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

    Object-Oriented:
        Java is based on the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), supporting concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

    Simple Syntax:
        Java's syntax is similar to C++, making it easier for developers familiar with those languages to adopt it.

    Automatic Memory Management:
        Java includes garbage collection, which automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation.

    Multithreading:
        Java provides built-in support for multithreaded programming, allowing concurrent execution of code.

    Rich Standard Library:
        JDK 1.0 introduced a set of standard libraries for tasks such as networking, data structures, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

    Applets and AWT:
        Java applets could be embedded in web pages, and the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) provided basic GUI components.

Java 1.1 brought significant enhancements to the language, including:

    Inner Classes: Support for nested classes.
    JavaBeans: Introduction of reusable components with standard conventions.
    Reflection: Ability to inspect and manipulate classes and objects at runtime.
    JDBC: Database connectivity API for interacting with databases.
    Enhanced AWT: Improved GUI components and event handling.

Java 1.2 introduced several important features, including:

    Collections Framework: Unified data structures like lists, sets, and maps.
    Swing: A new GUI toolkit for building rich interfaces.
    Event Dispatch Thread (EDT): Ensured that GUI components are updated on a single thread.
    New Security Features: Improved security architecture for applications.
    Java 2 Platform: Rebranding and enhancements to the Java platform.
